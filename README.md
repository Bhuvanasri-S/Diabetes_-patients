# Diabetes_-patients
This project involves exploring trends, identifying risk factors and developing insights to guide patient care
# Diabetes Prediction with Python

This repository contains Python code for predicting diabetes in patients using machine learning techniques. The project utilizes the scikit-learn library for building and evaluating machine learning models.

## Dataset

It contains various medical attributes of patients, such as glucose concentration, blood pressure, and BMI, along with an outcome indicating whether the patient has diabetes or not.

## Requirements

To run the code in this repository, you need to have Python installed on your system. Additionally, the following Python libraries are required:
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install these libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn




Feel free to customize the README file according to your specific project details, such as adding more information about the machine learning models used, the preprocessing steps applied to the data, or any additional features of the project.
